For installation instructions of the KFilter, read INSTALL.txt.

To use the kalman classes :
#include "kalman/ekfilter.hpp"

Don't forget to link the .a (-lkalman) on UNIX/Linux or the .lib on Windows. 
The include path must be accessible (nothing to do on UNIX/Linux, set the 
include path on Windows).
